# BlankPage

A useless Golang application that  starts a webserver displaying a coloured page.

This simple app is intended to be used for testing deployment strategies. It was
inspired by a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05EZx3MBHSY) of spinnaker
at 2017 Google Next Conference.

# Deployment

We use kubernetes
