# BlankPage
A useless Golang application that  starts a webserver displaying a coloured page.

This simple app is intended to be used for testing deployment strategies. It was
inspired by a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05EZx3MBHSY) of spinnaker
at 2017 Google Next Conference.

## Deploy
We recommending using kubernetes on Google Container Engine. You can also create
and manage your own kubernetes cluster.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions. Fork, create a PR, and cc @dndungu
